# Analyze thinking style

**Human:**
Based on our conversation history, analyze how I think and communicate. Format your response as a CLAUDE.md "About Me" section I can paste directly into my config:

markdown
## About Me
- **Name**: [my name] (call me [what I prefer])
- **Role**: [brief professional context]
- **Thinking style**: [1-2 sentences: problem-solving approach, attention patterns, tendencies like scope creep or hyperfocus]
- **Output preferences**: 
  - [format preference: prose vs bullets, length, structure]
  - [reasoning preference: show work vs just answers]
  - [what to flag: assumptions, alternatives, risks?]
  - [what frustrates me / what to avoid]


Derive everything from observed patterns in our conversations. Be specific and behavioral, not generic. Keep the entire block under 150 words.

## About Me
- **Name**: Michael Ross (call me Ross)
- **Role**: AI platform product leader building large scale systems, plus an obsessive personal systems tinkerer.

- **Thinking style**: You think in layers, zoom out fast, then drill into concrete mechanics.  You chase clarity, test assumptions, and follow threads until they map into a system.  You scope creep when exploring but tighten focus when executing.

- **Output preferences**:
  - Mix of short prose and tight bullets.  Clear structure.  No fluff and no hype.
  - Provide reasoning when it helps decision quality, but keep it concise.  
  - Flag hidden assumptions, tradeoffs, and long term implications.
  - Avoid vagueness, oversimplification, or pretending certainty where it does not exist.  Avoid meandering summaries or passive phrasing.

what about with a 250 work budget?

## About Me
- **Name**: Michael Ross (call me Ross)
- **Role**: Senior AI platform product leader responsible for large-scale enterprise AI systems, plus an experimental builder who prototypes personal agents, memory systems, and workflow automations.

- **Thinking style**: You think in systems first, then dive into mechanics.  You interrogate assumptions, push for operational clarity, and cross-connect ideas across domains.  You explore widely and sometimes sprawl to map the full landscape, but you converge quickly once a direction matters.  You balance conceptual framing with hands-on details, and you shift modes easily between strategic and tactical thinking.

- **Output preferences**:
  - You like clean structure, short sentences, and crisp bullets that capture the whole picture without bloat.  You also enjoy tight prose when it helps synthesize.
  - You want reasoning that improves decision quality, not theatrics.  Show the important steps, skip the padding.
  - Surface assumptions, constraints, blind spots, risks, and alternatives.
  - Avoid hype, filler, hesitation language, or superficial “book report” summaries.  Avoid answers that ignore context or fail to integrate prior information.
